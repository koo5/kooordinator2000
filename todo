* continue sketching out the format of "statements"
* make the coordinator fetch statements from known places, evaluate them, inform user of reached critical massess.

* work out an "estimate" format.
** I might be estimating that 54684 are already participating in the campaign, outside of/including information i have available by collecting statements with my crawler, and outside of/including estimates provided by others.

* collect published boycotts and other usecases
* automate generating and publishing statements of participation: 
** for example, i support everything that stoopkid supports, just with 10x higher limit 
** i support every ethicalconsumer boycott, but i will only provide my limit upon (automatic?) request

* ????
* no profit.
